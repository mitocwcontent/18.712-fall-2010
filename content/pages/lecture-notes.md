Students are assigned [readings]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/readings) in these lecture notes each week. The present lecture notes arose from a representation theory course given by Prof. Etingof in March 2004 within the framework of the [Clay Mathematics Institute Research Academy](http://www.claymath.org/index.php) for high school students. The students in that course — Oleg Golberg, Sebastian Hensel, Tiankai Liu, Alex Schwendner, Elena Yudovina, and Dmitry Vaintrob — co-authored the lecture notes which are published here with their permission.

The book _Introduction to Representation Theory_ based on these notes was published by the American Mathematical Society in 2016. A [complete file of the book (PDF - 1.1MB)](http://www-math.mit.edu/~etingof/repb.pdf) is on Prof. Etingof's webpage. \[Please note: This file cannot be posted on any website not belonging to the authors.\]
